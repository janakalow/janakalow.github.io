  - prepare for exams, viva, etc.
- We will use an online video conferencing system, e.g., Zoom or Google Meet. The actual link will be published in a WhatsApp group.
- There will be a "study master" to (i) study together with you and (ii) to regulate the session.
- Each session will be 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of focused time and 5 minutes of break time.
- When the focused time begins, you must declare the subject you will learn/research in the chat area. E.g. "Literature review of risk management."
- During the focused time, you will put away your mobile phone. You can still use your computer but not browse social media, play games or watch unrelated videos/reels.
- During the focused time, you must turn on your camera so the study master can see you.
- During the focused time, you study alone and do not interact with anyone physically or through online chat.
- See [Terms and Conditions](#terms-and-conditions) to manage your expectations.
